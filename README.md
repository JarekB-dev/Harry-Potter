## Theme

My decision was that the most appropriate approach would be to use colors from Hogwarts House of Main protagonist - Gryffindor, therefore I have used below colors:

    - #740001 - Dark Red
    - #D3A625 - Gold
    - #EEBA30 - Yellow

I wanted to make sure that colors have proper contrast and are easily read by visual impaired users, but also to be similar to the one used in Harry Potter logo. Also, font have been chosen with same in mind to make sure that all information is clear and easy to read. Therefore, game contain below font:
